Provide the estimated equation for this multiple regression model (e.g. if you chose your predictors to be $z_1 = x$ and $z_2 = log(x)$, your model would be of the form $y = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 log(x)$. Also provide the $R^2$ and mean square error of the fit for the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(d)** Visualize the model fit to the training data. Using both of the models you created in parts (b) and (c), plot the original data (as a scatter plot) AND the curves representing your models (each as a separate curve) from (b) and (c).\n",
    "\n",
    "**(e)** Now its time to compare your models and evaluate the generalization performance on held out test data. Using the models above from (b) an (c), apply them to the test data and estimate the $R^2$ and mean square error of the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(f)** Which models perform better on the training data, and which on the test data? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**(g)** Imagine that the test data were significantly different from the training dataset. How might this affect the predictive capability of your model? How would the accuracy of generalization performance be impacted? Why?\n",
